                Before Bhutan was consolidated into a kingdom, it consisted of many small principalities.
                <br>
                The regions had names like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lho Jong – "The Valley of the South"</li>
                <li>Lho Mon Kha Shi – "The Southern Mon Land with the Four Approaches"</li>
                <li>Lho Jong Men Jong – "The Southern Valley of Medicinal Herbs"</li>
                <li>Lho Mon Tsenden Jong – "The Southern Mon Valley Where Sandalwood Grows"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                First British travelers brought this name, which is believed to derive from the Sanskrit word
                "Bhot-anta"
                (Bhot = Tibet, anta = the end), meaning "the end of Tibet." Bhutanese themselves have always referred to
                their country as "Druk-Yul" – Land of the Thunder Dragon.

            <h4>Early Civilization</h4>
            Bhutan's history traces back to around 2000 BC, supported by archaeological evidence like stone tools and
            structures. The state of Lhomon, possibly existing between 500 BC and AD 600, has been theorized. Buddhism
            was introduced in the 7th century, with King Songtsen Gampo playing a crucial role. Early records were lost
            in a fire in 1827, but by the 10th century, Bhutan's religious history significantly influenced its
            politics. The country faced internal conflicts, and the Drukpa Lineage rose to prominence by the 16th
            century.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>European Contact</h4>
            Portuguese Jesuits visited Bhutan in 1627, marking the first European contact. Internal conflicts persisted,
            leading to wars with neighboring regions. Bhutan faced British intervention in the 18th century, culminating
            in the Duar War (1864–65) and the signing of the Treaty of Sinchula. In the late 19th century, civil war
            ensued, and Ugyen Wangchuck emerged victorious, becoming the hereditary king in 1907. Bhutan signed the
            Treaty of Punakha in 1910, aligning itself with British India. In 1953, King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck initiated
            democratic reforms, and in 1971, Bhutan joined the United Nations. King Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended to
            the throne in 1972.
            </p>

            <h4>Bhutan's Immigration Concerns and Refugee Crisis</h4>
            The 1980s saw Bhutan implementing policies to safeguard its cultural identity, including a census in 1988 to
            address concerns of illegal immigration. This led to protests, and the government responded with increased
            resistance. The census was used to identify and evict a significant number of Lhotshampas, resulting in
            their becoming refugees in southern Nepal. Western countries resettled many of these refugees since 2008.
